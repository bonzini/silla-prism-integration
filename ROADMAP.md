# Roadmap

1) Add entity to enable cahrge autorization
2) Add entity to disable charge autorization
3) Add entity to enable disable night mode

## Suggstions from users:

1) in the initial setup, in topic field, already put "home/prism/" instead of "prism/" since it's the default topic that Prism has when enabling MQTT;
2) set "sensor.silla_prism_session_output_energy" and "sensor.silla_prism_total_output_energy" unit in kWh instead of Wh and precision at 0,1 instead of 0,001 3) for better readability;
4) set "sensor.silla_prism_session_time" unit in hours instead of seconds;
5) set "sensor.silla_prism_output_current" unit in A instead of mA and precision at 0,1 instead of 0,001
